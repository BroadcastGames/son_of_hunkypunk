Status
=============
Git Interpreter 1.3.4 is currently integrated with this code. However, the Glk interface to Android still lacks key features:

1. Multiple windows
2. Unicode


Games to test features
==========================

This is not intended to be a comprehensive list, but merely a list of games to demonstrate current problems with the code and work to be completed.

Crashes

1. "Molly_and_the_Butter_Thieves.gblorb" crashes the interpreter on startup.
2. "hobbit.blb" seems to loop and show nothing on startup.

Graphics

1. "carma.blb" will detect the lack of graphics support and properly displays an error message.

Unicode error messages in game output

1. "Pogoman GO!.gblorb" in opening messages.
2. "CounterfeitMonkey.gblorb" in opening messages.

Text coloring results in invisible text

1. "rover.gblorb" will not show the blue text that works on other interpreters. These appear early in the game.
