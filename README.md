Fork experimental development of Son of HunkyPunk, see the original project https://github.com/retrobits/son_of_hunkypunk

So far, major changes beyond app version 0.9.0:

 1. Android Studio 2.2.2, SDK 24 and related Gradle updates.
 2. Git Interpreter upgraded from version 1.2.8 to version 1.3.4 with crash fixed due to long to jlong corruption.
 3. Some Git crashes are now trapped. It is still incomplete but less likely to hard-crash the entire app.
 4. RecyclerView GameListActivity now available. It is not very pretty and needs visual work, but it is a clean implementation and works with the established backend database.
 5. Common code to the old GamesList and new GameListActivity moved to common class outside the Activity.
 6. Multiple file paths are scanned for games. User Interface work not done on pick this yet, only hard coded paths.
 7. Unicode logic from Twisty app 2.0 (unreleased) has been hacked in and now Unicode output works much better in both Z-machine and Glulx story files generated by Inform 7 release 6M62!
 8. Greenrobot EventBus is introduced and background threads can operate more freely when the user rotates the screen or switches to another app.
 9. Gradle is used to control the applicationId and version of the build to allow multiple installs on the same device to compare new and old releases.
10. A sample game is now provided in the app assets and a setting decides if it is automatically installed on first run. It is a pure Public Domain story and can be distributed with zero copyright concern. This also paves the way for 'dedicated apps' that use SOHP as a distribution platform for their single story.

Side effects of the upgrade:

1. App Icon no longer apperas on the Title / Action Bar.  SDK 21 and newer convention change. Reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26720759/no-app-icon-on-actionbar
2. Colors on app first install are no longer dark and is a bright color set.
3. RecyclerView doesn't have the swipe navigation implemented.

We could implement these as 'build options' and possibly even a second 'build option' to present the user with preferences.

Kind of a vague concern: Google Play may not put the app in promos and 'featured apps' if it doesn't conform to modern style standards.

General observations:

1. in-game status bar/window font is often small. Were the score and other output goes for games.
2. The pre-set package of games to download disappears if any game is found. Maybe have a off the path way to redo this manually for user?
3. Picking the file path is clumsy on first startup. The app encourages you to install games immediately without setting the path and can orphan some downloads on path change.
4. Default to non SD-Card storage should probably increase compatibility of devices.
5. Some hard-coded testing game paths were added /sdcard/storyGames0 and /sdcard/storyGames1 to speed up testing of Git Interpreter / Glk changes.
6. Network activity related to looking up game details & graphics should probably be a preference option.
